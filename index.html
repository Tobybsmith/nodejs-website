                        This website is a place where I am learning front end web development. Most of the website changes daily and will look less ugly as time goes on.
                        It probably does not work on a browser other than Firefox.

                        You can see all my interesting CSS and JavaScript projects in the "Projects" section. You can see my girlfriend's work in the "Emma" section. EC takes 
                        you to the Extremely Corporate Webiste.
